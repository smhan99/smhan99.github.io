    long: `Homomorphic Encryption (HE) allows for arithmetic operations on encrypted data. My senior project focuses on 
           leveraging this property to create a secure online voting platform. Using HE, the vote and ballot does not need 
           to be decrypted until the voting process is over. We hope that this addition of security will lead to a future 
           of secure online voting platforms. We used IBM's HElib library and the BGV HE scheme. We use OpenSSL to provide 
           secure client-server socket connection. I received the 'Most Technically Difficult' Award for this project`,

    short: "Simulation of Biological Neurons Using Cellular Automata Technologies",
    long: `This paper emulates biological neural network and the communication that occurs within using Cellular Automata models. 
           A neuron communicates with each other through releasing chemical and electrical signals that propagate to other neurons connected through
           tiny region between neurons known as synapses. I create a MATLAB model of this propagation of signals, mimicing all processes necessary for
           a successful transfer of signal such as: membrane potential, action potential threshold, and refactory period. The simulation was able to 
           recreate some 'wave-like' propagation in a particular direction, creating a visual effect of some 'signal' propagating through a neural network.
           This paper was featured in August 2016 issue of Journal of Analysis of Applied Mathematics (AAM)`,

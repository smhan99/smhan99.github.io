    long: "Homomorphic Encryption (HE) allows for arithmetic operations on encrypted data. My senior project focuses on leveraging this property to create a secure online voting platform. Using HE, the vote and ballot does not need to be decrypted until the voting process is over. We hope that this addition of security will lead to a future of secure online voting platforms. We used IBM's HElib library and the BGV HE scheme. We use OpenSSL to provide secure client-server socket connection.",
